    "Python is a programming language developed by Guido van Russom in the year 1989. At that time he was working on another programming language called ABC at CWI (Centrum voor Wiskunde en Informatica). During the Christmas of 1989 Guido was looking for a hobby project to keep himself busy and he started writing an interpreter for a new scripting language that would be a descendant of ABC. "
