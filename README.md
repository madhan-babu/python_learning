# python_learning

Python is a beautiful yet simple programming language that has been gaining popularity with each passing year. I am personally a big fan of the language and have been coding in Python for around 7 years now. 

This repository contains a series of Jupyter notebooks with each covering a specific topic. There is no assumption made on the level of programming experience a reader has and it is written in a very basic form. Please start from the index.ipynb and try to cover the topics in the same order.

Why Jupyter notebooks? Simply put, this is the best way to combine text, images and code in a single artifact. It lets everyone to read a particular topic and execute code without having to copy paste into another editor.

Is there anything new about Python in these notebooks that other authors have not written about? Absolutely no and in fact I learnt Python reading multiple onlne articles. But this is my take on reaching out to those who don't have programming experience and helping them learn Python from basics to advanced. 

You are free to download the notebooks and use it for self learning or for teaching others.
